## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to specific project folder
3. Follow project-specific README instructions
4. Install required dependencies
5. Run the implementation


## Development Notes

- All projects are prototypes for educational purposes
- Medical certification would be required for clinical use
- Additional safety features needed for deployment
- Regular maintenance and calibration required

For detailed information about each project, please refer to their individual README files within their respective directories.
